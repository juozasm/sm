# Supermetrics Assignment

Made an app with vite React-ts config.
Used external libs: jest, react-router, axios

## Notes

Token is saved to localStorage. There logout button added. If posts endpoint fail, token is removed.

Login screen uses native html email validation, for implementation speed, also uses form event t gather all inputs, for less code and performance

Tested only most difficult functions. Could be added react testing library for integration.

## To run app

1. npm install
2. npm run dev

## To build app

1. npm run build

## To test app

1. npm run test
